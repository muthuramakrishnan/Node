To write data to the file

FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("abc.txt");
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f); ==> this also has boolean append
FileWriter fw = new createNewFile(String fname, boolean append); //true --> appends, //false --> overwrites

If the file is not available, all these constructors will create a file & work on it


Methods
fw.write(int ch); //unicode value of character
fw.write(char[] ch)
fw.write(String s)
fw.flush()
fw.close()

problems
//should insert a line sepearter manually

Next level writer is --> BufferedWriter & PrintWriter

flush() writes the content of the buffer to the destination and makes the buffer empty for further data to store but it does not closes the stream permanently. That means you can still write some more data to the stream.

But close() closes the stream permanently. If you want to write some data further, then you have to reopen the stream again and append the data with the existing ones.
